# Task Manager Project

This project consists of two parts:
1. Frontend (React) - located in the `taskmanager-frontend` folder
2. Backend (Django REST Framework) - located in the root folder

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Frontend (React)
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:
   cd taskmanager-frontend

2. Install dependencies (only required the first time):
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   npm start

The frontend will run on:
http://localhost:3000

---

### Backend (Django)
1. Stay in the root folder of the project.

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   Windows (PowerShell):
   venv\Scripts\activate

   Linux/Mac:
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Run the Django development server:
   python manage.py runserver

The backend will run on:
http://localhost:8000

## âš¡ Usage
- Frontend (React) makes requests to the backend API.
- Main API endpoint for tasks:
  http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/

- Home route `/` in the backend also serves tasks.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Make sure both frontend and backend servers are running for the application to work correctly.
- If using React proxy, ensure the proxy is correctly set in `taskmanager-frontend/package.json`.
